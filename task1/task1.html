                “The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
                refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go
                out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer.
                The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention
                you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.”</p>
